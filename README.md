**“Gestalt Engine”** is a standalone and improved version of the one found in **“Reinforced Mechanoids 2”**. It allows the player to control mechanoids without the need for a mechanitor. On top this version also adds a new mechanoid, the Matriarch, which can gestate new mechanoids.

Every aspect of it was made to fit into Rimworld perfectly. From the artstyle, do the way it works. For people who disagree with my balancing, the mod includes extensive mod options to tweak it to your liking!
